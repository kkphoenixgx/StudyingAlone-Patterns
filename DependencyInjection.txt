--Dependency Injection--

Dependency Injection is a way of looking for a code,
is a Refined way of look for a code, a code have yours
dependencies, that is all the stuff that a code needs
for run, when a dependency is a class and you have export
that to use like a import, that is a "PT-BR = m√≥dulo" 
"En - module".

The Dependency Injection is basically the concept that
things have to be separated for easily implementation, so
classes and others can't be dependents of another class
You have to do a way that the class can run alone, for 
easily debug and implementations.
