There is three stages of linkage:

stage 1-  from portuguese "Ameba" 
that is the moment of our problem that you don't know
what belongs to what, all the components are together
stage 2- "divided but neighbors"
All the script is divided, but the functions know each 
other and on a explicit form, call each other
stage 3 - "god like or black market"
All of the components don't know each other and all of 
them just don't call each other.
