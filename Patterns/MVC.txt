--MVC--

- MVC - Model view controller - 
You already know it but the mvc is pretty bad for big Interpreses 
because that is pretty bad for updates.

- Design Layer Architecture (arquitetura em camadas)- 

  On this pattern there is no limit of layers that you 
  can put it but put too many layers can plastering our
  code the function of the layer have to be clear and
  pretty good commentated:

  * layers:

  Controller=
  [responsável por gerenciar as requisições e as respostas]
  Have the responsibility of manage requisitions and answers
  of the script's flow.
  Servisses = 
  Have the responsibility of manage the business rule.
  Repository = 
  Have the responsibility of manage the db.
  Entity=
  the db's table on the application

    Web -> controller -> services -> 
    entities[crate a new object] -> repository ->
    Repository -> service -> controller -> 
    to who asked the requisition

    *but this paterns have a down point too, creating a lot of
    layers can down the performance of the site*
